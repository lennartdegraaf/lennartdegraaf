## Lennarts profile page

Hello there, I'm Lennart, teacher at Fontys ICT and mainly active within whats called 'Open Learning', both on locations Eindhoven and Tilburg and both in our daytime and evening education. 

Iâ€™m currently working on a lot of things, but i'm mostly involved in building a system that aims at fighting loneliness when patients are hospitalized. 

Also we're busy on experimenting on how generative AI tooling is transforming education. Very interesting stuff happening there!
